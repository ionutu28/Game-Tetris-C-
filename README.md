# 🎮 Tetris Game in C++

This project is a classic **Tetris game** developed in **C++** using an object-oriented design. The game replicates the core mechanics of the original Tetris: falling tetromino pieces, piece rotation, collision detection, line clearing, and scoring. It was created as a learning project to improve skills in structuring C++ applications and implementing real-time logic in games.

## 🧩 Project Description

The game runs in a console window (or basic graphics mode, depending on configuration), and each tetromino piece behaves as expected — it falls, can be moved left/right, rotated, and drops faster when a key is pressed. When a full line is completed, it is cleared, and the score is updated accordingly.

This project gave me the opportunity to better understand how game loops work, how to manage memory and classes in C++, and how to detect collisions in a 2D matrix-based game world.
